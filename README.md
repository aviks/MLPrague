# Machine Learning with Julia 

This repository contains the course materials for the "Machine Learning with Julia" worksop at Machine Learning Prague, Feb 2021. 

Install Julia from https://julialang.org/downloads

After checking out this repo, navigate to this directory, and start Julia. Then, on the Julia REPL

```julia
julia> pwd()
"C:\\path\\to\\MLPrague"

julia>]

(MLPrague) pkg> activate .

(MLPrague) pkg> instantiate

```

After this is done, you can execute the code in these files line by line. This is best done within an IDE, such as VSCode or Atom, with the corresponding Julia plugins installed. All of this will be demonstrated during the workshop.
